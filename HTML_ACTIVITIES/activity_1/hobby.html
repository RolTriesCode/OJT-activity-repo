        <h1>Photography: Capturing Moments That Matter</h1>
        <h2>Why I love Photography</h2>

        <p>
            Photography allows me to capture beautiful moments and preserve them forever. Whether it's a breathtaking
            sunset, a family gathering, or an unexpected candid shot, every picture tell a unique story.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond just taking pictures, photography helps me see the world differently. It has taught me to appreciate
            light, colors, and details I would have otherwise overlooked.
