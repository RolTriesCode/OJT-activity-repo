It took me 1hr to finish the task.

REFLECTION:
I struggled with choosing the right colors because I couldn’t inspect the image provided. I also found it challenging to manage the spacing and positioning of the elements, as well as determining the appropriate font sizes. These difficulties made it harder to replicate the design accurately, but I learned to pay closer attention to visual hierarchy and layout.
